E-Commerce Linear Regression Model - Streamlit App.  This repository contains a Streamlit app that allows users to interact with a trained Linear Regression model built on an e-commerce dataset. The model predicts user metrics with an accuracy of 98%.

Due to the small dataset size, slight overfitting may occur, but the app demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated into real-world e-commerce data for predictive analytics. The model was trained, pickled, and deployed via Streamlit to offer an interactive user experience.

Key Features:

1. Linear Regression model with high accuracy (98%)
2. Interactive Streamlit interface for user input
3. Trained on e-commerce data 
4. Model pickled for reuse
